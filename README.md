# WordPress Skeleton Application

Welcome to WordPress! This repository is a starting point for building your WordPress application, including all the base directories.

## Directories

The `docs/` directory is a special directory that contains your documentation for your application. It is not mounted onto your site, but is available for you to use. See [docs/index.php](docs/index.php) for more information.

## Your documentation here

Feel free to add to or replace this README.md content with content unique to your project, for example:

- Project-specific notes; like a list of environments and branches,
- Workflow documentation; so everyone working in this repo can follow a defined process, or
- Instructions for testing new features.

This can be detailed in the `docs/` directory.
